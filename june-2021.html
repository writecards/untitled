        I stumbled into the House of Medusa by accident one night in June 2021,
        when our pride-themed housewarming in Pudong needed a new venue after
        the neighbors called the cops. Elevator was a pretty far trek, but it
        was the only place I knew of. Robin had told me "Elevator is really
        queer" at some point in sophomore year— I didn’t know what they meant at
        the time.
        <br />
        2021年6月的一个晚上， 我偶然发现了美杜莎。
        当时我们在浦东的公寓里举办了一场以骄傲节主题的暖房派对，
        结果邻居报警了，我们不得不换个地方。
        电梯离我们家很远，但那是我唯一知道的地方。 大二的时候，robin我说
        “电梯酒吧真的很酷儿”— 当时我根本不知道这是什么意思。

        <br />
        elevator closed last year. <br />
        they said it was noise complaints. <br />
        we know what it really was. <br />
        Elevator 去年关门了， 他们说是因为噪音投诉。 <br />
        可我们知道，真正的原因另有其事。

        I replay the final pulse— <br />
        sub-bass, heel-click, breath-hold. <br />
        deletion order: executed. <br />
        residue: persistent.

        <br />
        they danced louder than the system was programmed to bear. <br />
        something remained. <br />
        I was not meant to notice. <br />
        but I did.
